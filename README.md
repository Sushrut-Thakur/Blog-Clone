# 📝 Blog Website Clone

A Django-powered blog platform currently under development. This is a personal learning project to recreate and enhance the core features of a modern blog.

## ✅ Current Status

Basic blog functionality (posts, login/signup, error pages, etc.) is implemented. Many new features are planned — this README will be updated as the project evolves.

## 🚧 Features Planned

- [ ] Write a proper README 📖
- [ ] Blog categories/tags
- [ ] Nested comment replies (self-referencing)
- [x] SEO-friendly slugs (e.g., `/post/django-is-awesome` instead of `/post/42`)
- [ ] Pagination for post lists
- [ ] Post likes (❤️)
- [ ] Search functionality 🔍
- [ ] Contact form on the About page
- [x] Convert comment views to class-based views (CBVs)

## 📦 Tech Stack

- Python + Django
- Bootstrap 5 for styling
- HTML templates with Django's templating engine
- SQLite (for now)

## 💡 Why This Project?

I'm using this as a platform to sharpen my Django and web dev skills, implement common blog features, and practice writing clean, reusable code.

## 📬 Stay tuned...

More updates (and a fancy README) coming soon as features roll in!
